    <h4>What is Pair Programming?</h4>

    <p>Pair Programming is when two people work as a team to complete a
    programming project. This allows both developers
    to learn and grow through a process of teaching and mentoring.
    Developers can trade off of each role exchanging ideas and knowledge
    to complete the project.
    </p>

    <h4>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h4>

    <p>Pair programming creates a culture of working together. Working as a part
    of a team and being able to communicate and collaborate are required skills
    for programmers in the work place. Pair programming is becoming more
    popular in software companies because it reduces errors,
    transfers knowledge, and allows companies to quickly on-board new
    developers.

    <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>

    <p>The driver is the person at the keyboard typing the code, while the
    navigator is directing the driver. The navigator also checks for errors
    and typos. It is important that there is open communication and
    collaboration when pair programming.
    </p>

    <h4>Jessie's Reflections on Pairing</h4>
    <p>Pairing wiht Amadou was great! He was very easy to work with, and we collaborated easily. We traded off between driver and navigator many times during the session. We each had a different approach on the css portion, but we worked well together, and we're both happy with the final product.
