            <p>The lack of gender diversity in the tech industry has been a really hot news topic recently. In researching this, I found the following article on <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-state-of-women-in-technology-15-data-points-you-should-know/">TechRepublic.com</a> that had some really interesting and surprising statistics.</p>
            <h4> Why should women be more represented in the tech industry?</h4>
            <p>Well aside from the obvious, that we make up 50% of the population, there are some big reasons why it would make sense for there to be more women in general, and in leadership positions in the industry. Women use technology more, and we make the buying decisions for our households. We adopt new technology faster and on average user more tech devices than our male counterparts. If women are the majority consumers of technology why aren’t we also guiding its development and innovation?
            </p>
            <h4> Why aren’t there more women in tech?</h4>
            <p>Some people argue that women just don’t go into tech because they just aren’t that interested in it, and that there isn’t anything wrong with that. There is a greater debate about what messages we send to little girls that might be influencing whether or not they become interested in math and sciences in general, but I’m not going to get into that here. I can only share my personal story. </p>
            <p>I’ve been more interested in math and science than anything else since I was a little girl. These were my favorite subjects in school, and in my life today computer science and now programming are a natural fit for me. So why I didn’t I go straight into tech out of high school? Why do I have a BS in Accounting and not Computer Science? For me the reason was exposure. There was no computer programming class for me to take in high school. When I got to community college there was nothing on programming at all, although I did take a few computer classes. Unfortunately, by this point I knew more about building computers than some of my teachers did. I would have killed for a class on BASIC or C++. (I know, I just dated myself).  </p>
            <p>So even though I gravitated to technology on my own and with my friends, there was no path to it professionally for me. While my male friends were earning Microsoft certs and becoming network engineers, I was getting steered towards bookkeeping and accounting since I was good with numbers. Eventually, I found my way to tech anyway though accounting information systems and databases. That led me on the path toward making my own software, and eventually Dev Bootcamp. </p>
            <h4>Are we fixing this problem?</h4>
            <p>I think that we are. I’m doing my part by learning to be a software engineer, so we can add one more female developer to the rolls. More importantly though, we are creating more opportunities for young women to choose this path. That happens with coding programs in schools, and programs like Girl Develop It, and Girls Who Code. According to one statistic that I read, 2014 was the first time in history that there were more women enrolled than men in an introductory computer science class at Berkley. Give the industry some time to catch up, and the female representation will probably be closer to the average of 57% in other industries. </p>
