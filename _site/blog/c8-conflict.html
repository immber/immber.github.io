            <h4> Describe a time you had a conflict… </h4>
            <p>The conflict that comes to mind was super minor, but I was proud of how I handled the situation; so I think it makes a good example of an appropriate response. It happened at Costco, and involved a complete stranger and myself. After finishing shopping, got in line with my cart. It was a busy day, so I was about the third person in line when I got in line. Almost immediately one more person got in line behind me. As we’re all standing around waiting, I got out my phone and started scanning emails…like you do. </p>
            <h4> What was the source of the conflict? </h4>
            <p>As I was looking down, another shopper came and cut in line in front of me. Apparently while I was looking down a slight gap had opened between my cart and the person in line in front of me, but it was obvious that I was next in line. The gap wasn’t really enough space for a cart, so the person who was cutting was in line sideways at an odd angle. I assume they thought that I wouldn’t notice them, because I was distracted by my phone.</p>
            <h4>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h4>
            <p>When I realized that they had cut in line, I had a moment to consider my next action. Should I confront them, and tell them to go to the back of the line, or should I just let it slide, and not get into it with a stranger? I think everyone feels some apprehension when faced with a conflict, and has to decide how to proceed. I realized that they had cut not only me, but the people behind me as well, and that wasn’t fair to anyone. I decided to confront them. </p>
            <h4>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h4>
            <p>I got the attention of the person who had cut in front of me, and said, “Excuse me, the end of the line is behind them.” I was pointing to the people in line behind me. The person had the nerve to give me a look, like “Are you really going to make me go to the back of the line?” I think the line had gotten even longer by this point. I responded with a look of my own that said, “Yeah, why would you think you could just cut in line?” That was it. No other words were spoken, and they didn’t apologize for cutting in line, or act like it had been an accident. They just rolled their cart to the back of the line. </p>
            <h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
            <p>Absolutely nothing. Afterwards I was pretty glad that I had spoken up, and had not let them get away with it. Who does that?? Did they really think that I wouldn’t notice, or that they shouldn’t have to wait just like every other shopper?? Did they think it was okay because I was looking at my phone?? </p>
            <h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
            <p>I was reminded that we shouldn’t be afraid of conflict or confrontation, even with random strangers in extremely minor situations. This example shows that when you politely and directly address an issue, usually people will respond in a positive way. I think that some people would have let this slide in order to avoid the confrontation. I’m glad that I didn’t. I think that it’s a sign of my respect for myself that I won’t allow other people to disrespect me. </p>
