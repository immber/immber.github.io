# Mission Statement üéØ

We create products that serve niche audiences and ignite passion and joy. 

After more than 20 years‚Äô combined experience in software development and business management, Jessie Rushing founded CoastWeb, LLC in 2024 as a legal entity to protect and incubate her latest ideas. 

CoastWeb, LLC is dedicated to the development and support of products that serve as a counterbalance to the recent increase in racism, transphobia, authoritarianism, and fascism within the United States. We are selective about our business partners and tools, and stand firm in our convictions that diversity, equity, and inclusion are requirements for the success of modern organizations.

# About Us üòé

CoastWeb LLC is mostly Jessie Rushing, but the royal ‚Äúwe‚Äù also refers to business partners, subcontractors, and the extensive technical and professional networks at her fingertips. 

Prior to CoastWeb, Jessie:

* Managed operations for a startup that reached over $20+ million annual gross in under 2 years.
* Was a trusted advisor and consultant to growing SMBs in the $5 to $50 million range.
* Graduated from DevBootcamp, the first coding bootcamp in San Francisco.
* Built and scaled SaaS hosting infrastructure serving one of the most amazing open source products ever, to major media organizations globally.

Recently, Jessie has become obsessed with [@proto](https://atproto.com/), the open source protocol that [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) was built on. She continues to follow her passion for innovative technologies, and automated business operations.
