    <h4> My Personal Values: </h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Autodidacticism</li>
      <li>Challenge</li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
      <li>Freedom</li>
      <li>Money/ Economic security</li>
      <li>Ambition</li>
      <li>Achievement</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I think freedom is the most important value that I selected, because it is what allows you to pursue all of the other all of the other values. Money/economic security is often an important part of having the freedom to be creative, ambitious, and practice autodidacticism. When all of these are present, then you can really challenge yourself and reach achievement of your goals.</p>

    <h4> Last topic someone asked me for advice on?</h4>

    <p>I was discussing file version control with a friend, and he wasn’t familiar with Git or GitHub. I explained how Git and GitHub work, and how Git could be used for local version control and documentation of changes in different file branches/versions; even if the file types were CAD files instead of code files.</p>

    <h4>How do I feel when I think about my values? </h4>

    <p>I think this set of values describes my character very well. One of my best features is my ability to seek out and gather new information about a particular subject. When I don’t know something I immediately seek out the information needed. I do this for everything. I’m reminded of a few examples: </p>

    <p>For instance, a few years ago when I decided to by a flat screen TV for the first time, I spent several hours online learning everything I could find about TV features. When I finally picked out a TV, I knew what every single one of its features meant, and how it compared to other TV’s in its price range. </p>

    <p>I just recently did the same thing with running shoes. It got to the point that I was lecturing salespeople in shoe stores about the features that I wanted, and why, rather than have them explain the shoes to me. I eventually purchased an awesome pair of running shoes online, which were everything I was looking for and fit perfectly. </p>

    <h4>How can I mediate stereotype threat if I recognize that I feel it?</h4>

    <p>I think stereotype threat is all about intimidation and self-doubt. I usually don’t have an issue with self-doubt, and tend to be pretty confident. Of course I’m human too, so sometimes I will become intimidated or unsure of own ability. Especially when I feel like I should know more about a topic. At DBC the important thing for me to remember is that we’re all students in this environment, and keep the <a href="c1-chefs-kitchen.html">“kitchen vs. restaurant”</a> mindset. If I keep that in mind I think it will be easy for me to speak up if I don’t know something and not get intimidated. </p>

    <h4>What else can I do to help when I’m feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</h4>

    <p>When I feel down at DBC there are a number of things I can do. Recently, I have started building a little collection of inspirational bookmarks. These are blog posts, videos, articles, and other random webpages, that just make me feel good. I can spend a few minutes just perusing those to get a bit of quick inspiration. I also have a bunch of very supportive people at home that I can call, chat, or text with if I’m feeling low. </p>

    <p>Mostly I’m just so excited for this opportunity, that I can’t picture being unhappy at all while I’m at DBC, but I realize this is probably not a realistic expectation. I’m sure there will be times that I feel lonely, frustrated, broke, angry, or unsure. I’m pretty good at handling my emotions when they happen, so I’m positive that I’ll be able to overcome any of these challenges that might pop up. If this wasn't going to be at least a little hard, it wouldn't be worth doing. ;)</p>
