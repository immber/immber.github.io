   <p>I wasn’t sure what to expect when watching this video, but what happened was that I was overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude that I was going to get to be a part of this program. I didn’t know the back-story behind how DBC was founded, but I found that I could relate to it in many ways as I listened to what Shereef had to say.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been a part of many small businesses and startups and have pretty much spent my entire career with companies where a “roll up your sleeves and make this work” attitude was required and appreciated. I think those experiences are going to help me get into the “kitchen” mindset when I get onsite at DBC. I’m already impressed with the program after just 1 week of Phase 0, and feel like I’ve learned a lot. Not just about development or how to use the tools, but also about what the other side of this experience is going to be about: the mental, emotional, and personal development side.

It’s those aspects of this program that made it so much more attractive than just trying to teach myself Ruby with books and the internet. I’m excited to embrace the full experience from code to yoga, and grow into a whole new version of myself in the process. That doesn’t make me nervous at all. (Other things do of course, how much money I’m spending, if I’ll be able to use these skills in my career, what will happen after DBC, all that other stuff is totally scary shit.) ;)
