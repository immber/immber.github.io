    <h4> Ask What You Mean to Ask </h4>

    <p><i>“I tweeted the photo to my FaceBook, but now I don’t see it on my friend’s list. How do I get it to show up?.”</i></p>

    <p>Wait… you did what, and you’re trying to do what?? </p>

    <p>When it comes to anything technical I think the most important part of asking a good question is understanding the terminology and using it correctly so that you are asking the question that you mean to ask. It’s common for someone who doesn’t understand the terminology to use it incorrectly and that can make a question impossible to answer because it doesn’t make sense in the first place. </p>

    <p>While working as a software consultant I spent a lot of time interpreting my client’s questions to try to understand what they were really asking. In the example above, something simple like “How to post a photo to my friend’s FaceBook timeline?” would have been a much better question, and is likely to get a better response from someone with the technical knowledge needed to accomplish the goal. </p>


    <h4>The GOAL, the ATTEMPT, and the ERROR</h4>

    <p>When it comes to coding questions in particular, usually the situation is going to look something like this: </br>
      <ul>1. You are trying to do something specific,</br>
        2. You tried to do it a certain way, and</br>
        3. Either the result is not the behavior you expected or you’re getting an error message.</br></ul>

    <p>All three of these components need to be included in a good question. If the question were a statement instead it would look like this: “I’m trying to accomplish A (the goal) by doing B (the attempt), and I’m getting C (the error).” To translate that into a question you might phrase it something like this, “Using B to accomplish A, why am I getting C instead of A?”</p>

    <h4>Answering Your Own Question</h4>

    <p>Another thing to consider when phrasing and framing a question is: Would I be able to answer this if I knew the answer? Did you include all of the necessary details and information that someone will need to know to give you an answer? This is especially true if you’ve already tried the most logical first step(s) to fix an issue, and those didn’t work. You need to include that additional info of what you’ve already tried. In general you might include a snippet of code to help show what you’re doing, or include the specific error message text or a screenshot of the error that you’re getting. </p>

    <p>I have a handful of utility software applications that I developed for QuickBooks desktop and sell online. When I do support for my utility software apps, I always ask the user for a screenshot of the error message. That’s so much more helpful than “it doesn’t work” or “I get an error”. When I developed the applications, I handled the most common errors, so the error text tells me exactly what’s going on. This makes troubleshooting and answering user questions much easier.</p>

    <h4>Be Prepared to Give More Info</h4>

    <p>If you do post something in a forum or other location expecting an answer, it’s common to need to provide more information or details, so be prepared to provide that if you want to get the best answer to your question. If you want to get very comfortable with asking questions, and increase your technical knowledge at the same time, try answering other people’s questions. </p>
