    <h4> What is SQL Injection?</h4>

    <p>SQL Injection occurs when a user “injects” a SQL command into a user field on an application’s web page. This type of hack is usually designed to get data from the database that the application wouldn’t normally want to display, but it can also be used to delete or alter data in the application’s database.  </p>

    <p>A typical example would be a webpage with a username and password field: </p>

    <form>
      Username: <input type="text" name="username"><br>
      Password:  <input type="text" name="password">

    </form>

    <p>When the user enters their username, that text is typically going to be held inside a string variable. Then that string is going to be passed to the database as a part of a SQL command. If the user were to enter something like: <code>a’ or 1=1</code>. That string could end up getting “injected” into the SQL command, causing this:

    <pre><code>SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = ‘a’ or 1=1
    </pre></code>
    </p>

    <p>While this might look pretty harmless, if executed it would return all of the data from the “Users” table. That potentially could expose all kinds of user information to the hacker. </p>

    <p>Another example would be to append a new SQL command to the first one by entering something like this <code> 5; DROP TABLE Customers </code>. If this were injected into the same select statement above the result would be that the first statement would execute, which may or may not return a user, but then the second statement would completely delete the “Customers” table from the database.

    <pre><code> SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = 5; DROP TABLE Customers
    </pre></code>
    </p>

    <p>These are just a couple of examples. SQL Injection has been the method used to steal data in a number of infamous hacker attacks. There are other ways that dynamic SQL commands can be exploited as well; it doesn’t necessarily have to come from a web-form filled out by a user. Any SQL command that is passing part of the command in from a dynamic source can expose pretty much any type of SQL database. </p>

    <h4> How to prevent SQL Injection </h4>

    <p>So how do we as web developers prevent this type of vulnerability, and secure our sites and applications? The best prevention technique is to use SQL Parameters instead of passing the sting variables directly into the SQL command statements. This ensures that the parameters are validated and treated as data by the database. That way even if a malicious text string is entered, the database will recognize it as data instead of treating it as part of the SQL command. The exact method of creating parameters can vary slightly based on the type of SQL database the application is using.</p>

    <h4>SQL Parameterization in SQLite </h4>

    <p>SQLite uses something called a “Prepared Statement” which is an object. An instance of this object represents the SQL statement that will be executed. When you create the prepared statement object you specify what the statement will do, and what parameters it should expect. Think of this object as being kind of like a Ruby method  or JavaScript function that accepts arguments, and then if they are valid, executes what ever it was written to do. </p>

    <p>When the dynamic user data is passed into the parameters, it will be validated, and SQLite will evaluate the prepared statement only as intended without any extra commands or input from the user. In the example below, the SQL statement will UPDATE the “users” table and set the fields “first_name” and “last_name” to the values in the parameters for the user id specified. </p>

    <pre><code>
    stmt = db.prepare('UPDATE users SET first_name=?2, last_name=?3 WHERE id=?1')
    stmt.bind_param(1, 'id')
    stmt.bind_param(2, 'first')
    stmt.bind_param(3, 'last')
    stmt.execute

    </pre></code>

    <h4>Other Defenses- </h4>

    <p>In addition to using Prepared Statements, there are a few other ways that web developers can try to defend against SQL injection.  One is to use SQL Stored Procedures. The idea is similar to using prepared statements, in that Stored Procedures are like SQL methods that will only execute specifically predefined SQL commands. If using Stored Procedures, developers must take precautions to protect those procedures themselves from being vulnerable to SQL Injection. </p>

    <p>Another option is commonly referred to as “escaping user input”. This basically means adding a “blacklist” of characters that will be escaped in any user input strings so that the database will recognize the text as data instead of SQL code.  This technique reduces the likelihood that a user can insert certain characters into a SQL command that would be necessary for it to run, but it’s the least effective defense because it doesn’t defend for every possible type of malicious SQL statement. </p>

    <p>In addition to these options, also limiting the permissions on your databases can protect them from front end users being able to make detrimental changes to the database. All database accounts should be restricted to only the data that they really need to access, and in most cases the amount of access such as Read, Create, Update, or Delete should also be controlled. </p>
