  <h4> My Thinking Style </h4>

  <p>One of the fantastic things about DevBootcamp is that not only are we learning to write code, we are also learning about ourselves, and more importantly, how to learn. An exercise that demonstrates this is the Gregoric Thinking Style.  You can take the test here and go through the process for yourself at <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink</a></p>
  <p>After going through the questions, I identified that my Gregorc Thinking Style is mostly Abstract Sequential.  Although, I'm also equal parts Concrete Random and Concrete Sequential. My lowest score was in the Abstract Random area. You can read more about what each of those groups means at <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style</a></p>
  <p>For me, the description for Abstract Random thinkers really fit my personality. We like to do a lot of analysis before making a decision, and use logic to work through problems in a linear fashion. We also tend to be independent learners who do best with lots of access to resources.</p>
  <p>It sounds like my learning style is really well geared toward both the environment and the subject matter at DBC. Programming is based on logic, so it will help me that I tend to approach problems in a linear and logical way. I will also do well with challenges that allow me to work alone to solve a stimulating problem, but where I’m also provided reference sources to help me along the way.</p>
  <p>DBC has really gone out of it’s way to condense a lot of the “fluff” out of a traditional learning environment where you repeat the same material over and over again. This is part of what was so attractive to me about DBC in the first place. As an abstract sequential thinker, I like to move on quickly to the next thing, rather than repeat tasks over and over again. I get bored doing the same thing over and over again.</p>
  <p>Some challenges that I might face in this environment are working with unpredictable personalities, or being involved with disorganized group projects. These are things that my sequential thinking style doesn’t deal with very well.  If I can adopt a “Growth Mindset” I can try to recognize when situations are presented that call for a more abstract learning style. Thinking more creatively and “outside of the box” is something that I would like to practice, and will hopefully get better at as I progress through the DBC challenges.  Hopefully, by expanding the ways in which my brain learns I’ll be able to also expand the way that it thinks and approaches problems.
