      <h4>What is Version Control, and why do you need it?</h4>
      <p>
        When you start developing applications the first thing you'll realize is that each application is really made up of lots and lots of different files. Each one is in some way involved in making the complete application work. Many of these files will be interconnected and "talk" to each other, thus making your program run.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time you want to make a change to your application, be it fix a bug, or add a new feature, or just tweak something small you'll go in and edit one or more of those files. Well how do you keep track of which files you've changed, and what changes you made in the event that one of your changes makes it so that all of the files keep playing nicely with each other? Enter Version Control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version Control is basically just keeping a record of what changes you made, when you made them. How do you manage all of that? Well you could write it down somewhere or you could use a software program that's designed to keep track of every change you make automatically for you. This is what Git does.
      </p>
      <h4>What is Git, and why is it awesome?</h4>
      <p>
        Git is a software application that runs from the command prompt. Once installed you use Git to make local repositories on your system. These are like folders where you store all of those files that make up your application. Git watches those folders for you and keeps track of all the changes you make. It can also help you undo changes and revert back to a previous version of a file if you make a mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git is awesome, because it is really fast and easy to use. It does all the work of tracking changes for you, and you just have to let it know when you want it to take "snapshots" of the current state of your files. When you do that you make a "checkpoint" that you can come back to later if any future changes break something. Another reason Git is awesome is that it also integrates with GitHub.com.
      </p>
      <h4>What is GitHub.com, and why should you use it?</h4>
      <p>
        GitHub.com is like having an online backup copy of your code that you can also share with anyone in the world. If you've "pushed" your files up form your local folders to GitHub.com you can access them from anywhere. If something happens to your computer you won't lose all those important files that make your application work.
      </p>
      <p>
        GitHub.com is also a social site that allows developers from everywhere to share and distribute source code, sample files, libraries, and entire applications. You can use it to show examples of your work to a potential employer, or make an open source project available to the world. Or you can just keep private copies of your own programs for your own use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Git and GitHub.com are the tools that allow developers to manage Version Control.
