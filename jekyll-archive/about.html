        <h3>About Jessie</h3>
        <p>I started JR Consulting because I realized that I had a unique range of experience, and that my expertise could be a value to growing businesses. </p>
        <p>Many years ago, I started my career working in a warehouse packing and shipping orders. I saw firsthand how to, and how NOT to manage inventory. From there I worked my way up to Operations Manager and that’s where I learned how to make all of the parts of a puzzle fit together. </p>
        <p>As a math geek, I naturally gravitated towards accounting, and since I was working in smaller organizations, that meant learning QuickBooks inside and out. I eventually earned a BS in Accounting, and continue to appreciate the beauty of perfectly balanced general ledger. </p>
        <p>The further I got into accounting though, the more I became fascinated by the technology that drives the everyday transactions. As a software consultant I’ve worked with ERP, MRP, CRM, and WMS systems, and I still can’t get enough of the IT stuff.</p>
        <p>At JR Consulting we unite the functions of Operations, Accounting, and IT. Our unique approach is how we make growing businesses thrive. </p>
