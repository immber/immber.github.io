            <h4>What’s it like to Pair Program in DBC? </h4>
            <p>Having only ever played around with software development on my own prior to starting Phase 0 of DBC, pair programming was a new concept for me. Pairing allows two developers to work on the same project together. This is great because it means that you get to collaborate in real time with someone else on how to solve a challenge. During a pair session, communication is key. All of my pair sessions so far have been great! The other boots are so interesting, and it’s fun to see how other people approach and solve problems. </p>
            <p>I personally have a lot experience in tech support and troubleshooting. In those sessions I’m usually working with a user who knows nothing about the problem or issue that they are having, and I have to walk them (slowly) through the process of resolving it. I don’t think this experience is helping me a very good pair. I notice myself taking over, and trying to be the person both driving and navigating. I’ve discovered that this is something I’m going to have to work on so that I can be a better pair. </p>
            <h4>What kind of feedback do you get?</h4>
            <p>DBC has a system for providing anonymous feedback to your pair partners, and this system has a built in rating system. Other boots rate all feedback before it is delivered to you to see if it is specific, actionable, and kind. So far, I haven’t seen anything in my feedback that was surprising to me. I have received some comments that I “micromanaged a little bit” and that I “kind of did <my> own thing while driving instead of following the navigator's recommendation”. It seems that the pairs who were slightly less comfortable with the challenges themselves seemed to appreciate me taking over a little more than the ones who were more comfortable with the material. </p>
            <p>This just stresses to me that I need to keep in mind that I’m not on a session with an end-user who doesn’t know their stuff. I’m working with a peer who is probably just as capable (if not more so) than I am, and I need to be really cognizant of not taking over.  </p>
            <h4>What’s it like to give feedback?</h4>
            <p>Giving feedback can be challenging especially if you’ve just had a great session and don’t really have any constructive criticism to offer. When trying to come up with feedback, you are trying to be specific, actionable, and kind.  Being specific is easy. I can usually think of a few examples from the session of something that worked really well, or didn’t. I don’t think I have a problem being kind, and none of my feedback has been rated as not being kind, so that part is easy. It’s the actionable part that is always the hardest for me.  I try to come up with some advice for my pair, but this just makes me feel like I’m directing too much or “micro-managing” again, so that is the part that I usually struggle with the most. </p>
            <h4>Overall, does this work?</h4>
            <p>Absolutely. Having the experience of working with other boots, is definitely a valuable part of the process at DBC, and pair programming in Phase 0 is just our fist taste of that. I have learned more tips, tricks, and shortcuts during pairing sessions than from any other source. From keyboard shortcuts to terminal tricks, there are a bunch of little bits of information that just wouldn’t get shared any other way. In addition, there’s the benefit of knowing more about how I work with others, and having lots of opportunities to improve. </p>
