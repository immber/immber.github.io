            <h4> My first experience with Stereotype Threat</h4>
            <p>I’ve never had an issue being a women working in a so-called “man’s” field. I’ve never worried about my performance compared to anyone of a different gender. In fact gender doesn’t usually even register in my professional life. I have always strived to be the best possible at what ever it is that I’m doing, and to continuously try to improve. I’m usually very confident in my abilities, and I’m not afraid to ask for help when I know my skills aren’t up to a task. This has just always seemed like the most logical way to work at anything.</p>
            <p>Having been this way my entire professional life, I was very surprised when I encountered my first experience with stereotype threat here in Phase 0 of DBC. Perhaps similar occurrences have happened before, but I just wasn’t cognizant of them. In this case I was very cognizant.</p>
            <p>After starting Phase 0, a few weeks in I was reassigned to a new accountability group for our first true group challenge. I went from a group that was just me and another female developer, to being added to an established group of three guys. Honestly, if the issue of gender diversity in tech wasn’t such a hot topic right now, I don’t know if I would have even noticed that I was just added to a group that was all male. During the challenge, I had a moment where I knew that there was something wrong with someone else’s code, but I wasn’t sure exactly what it was. Suddenly out of nowhere I doubted myself and my ability to solve the challenge. Instead of reporting back to my group that there was a problem, I prepared to turn the challenge in not working, and even pushed the broken solution to github. </p>
            <p>Then I got mad at myself. I knew that I had copped out of this challenge, but I was for some reason too intimidated to go to the group and tell them it was wrong. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. I’m not usually easily intimidated. Eventually one of the other group members acknowledged the issue, and after that I felt comfortable speaking up about what was wrong with the code. I eventually went back through the challenge, reviewed all the code and tests, and worked with the group to completely solve all four components. I was the first one to push the solution to github for the group to review. After that I had my confidence back. </p>
            <h4> How can I prevent this from happening again? </h4>
            <p>This first occurrence had a pretty significant impact on me. In the future, now that I’m aware of this, I hope that I’ll be able to recognize those feelings of intimidation initially so that I can counter them immediately. It will help that the end result of this occurrence was a positive experience that allowed me to demonstrate that my ability was at least as good as that of my peers in the group. I can keep that in mind if I ever start to get intimidated and am holding back from speaking up again. </p>
            <h4>How can I keep this from happening to others?</h4>
            <p>I don’t know if there is much that I can do to prevent stereotype threat in others. I think that intimidation is at the route of this issue; so by contributing to a work environment that is open and accepting, that will help to limit anyone from feeling intimidated because of stereotype threat or for any other reason. I can be more conscious of this in the future, and if I feel like someone I’m working with is feeling intimidated I can take extra steps to make sure that person feels comfortable sharing and contributing. </p>
